Dear Anjali,

queen of spreadsheets, best planner we know, birthday party setter-upper and spirit and mom of any group: we miss u and we love you!! Hope you have the happiest 21st birthday. 
You made ours this summer feel so so special, and it'll forever remain a core memory of summer 2025 :D 
We know you're going to go on to do great things, keep us in the loop on the tea and the lore!!
