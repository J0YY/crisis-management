Dear Anjali,

You are the coziest corner of our world. Thank you for every late-night voice note, every “are you home safe?” text, every time you made us laugh when we were spiraling. You make chaos feel like home and hope feel reachable.

We love you more than spreadsheets, memes, and perfectly timed snacks.

Happy birthday — you are so deeply cherished.

With all our ridiculous, relentless love,
Joy & Socrates
